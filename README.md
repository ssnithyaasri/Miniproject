## PREDICTING WHETHER AN ASTEROID IS HAZRDOUS OR NOT USING MACHINE LEARNING
This project develops a machine learning model using logistic regression to predict whether an asteroid poses a hazard to Earth, based on features like size, velocity, and orbital parameters. Gradient descent is used to optimize the model, and data preprocessing ensures accurate and efficient predictions. The model aims to improve asteroid risk assessment and strengthen planetary defense strategies.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
This project develops a machine learning model to predict asteroid hazard risk to Earth using key features like size, velocity, and orbital parameters. Logistic regression is used for binary classification, determining whether an asteroid is hazardous or not. Gradient descent optimizes the model by adjusting the parameters to minimize prediction errors. Data preprocessing includes feature scaling and normalization to improve model performance, while cross-validation ensures robust and generalizable predictions. The model also applies feature selection to identify the most influential factors, aiming to enhance risk assessment and planetary defense strategies through accurate asteroid hazard predictions.

## System Architecture
<!--Embed the system architecture diagram as shown below-->
- The architecture begins with historical asteroid data, which is subjected to processes such as data analysis, preprocessing, and feature selection to prepare the dataset for model development.
- The prepared data is split into training and testing datasets.
- The training dataset is used to develop and select a robust model, while the testing dataset is used to refine the model using gradient descent optimization. 
- The optimized model undergoes testing to evaluate its performance, and the final predictions are generated to classify asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous. 
- This approach ensures reliable and accurate outcomes for asteroid hazard prediction.
